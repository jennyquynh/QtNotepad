# QtNotepad
A Qt text edit application, created for learning purposes.

I followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I96uPDifZ1w

Because this was my first Qt project, I documented each line of code with what I learned through researching the Qt documentation. 

I then used what I learned to make my own File menu option "Save", which was not included in the video tutorial.
